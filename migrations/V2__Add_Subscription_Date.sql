-- Since we already added subscription_date in the initial migration,
-- this migration does nothing but serves as a placeholder for future schema changes

-- Sample data insertion with specific names
INSERT INTO subscribers (email) VALUES ('rahi@example.com');
INSERT INTO subscribers (email) VALUES ('nidhip@example.com');
INSERT INTO subscribers (email) VALUES ('kirti@example.com');
INSERT INTO subscribers (email) VALUES ('raj@example.com');
